		<p>Hero Jump is a HTML5 Arcade Game. Fly as far as possible across the sky jumping on the platforms. Collect coins, use spring jumps and the super jump power-up to get extra points! <br>
			
			<br>
			The ZIP package contains the game with 640x960 resolution that scales to fit the whole screen device<br>
			Just warning that for very wide screens, the game may not be perfectly full screen.
			The game is fully compatible with all most common mobile devices.<br>
			Sounds are enabled for mobile but we can't grant full audio compatibility on all mobile devices due to some well-know issue between some mobile-browser and HTML5.
			So if you want to avoid sound loading, please read <a href="#disable_sound">Disable Sound</a> section). <br>
			<strong>WARNING:</strong> Sounds can't be enabled for Windows Phone as this kind of device have unsolved issues with 'audio' and 'video' tag.

				<li><strong>Game Embedding: </strong>The proper way to embed the game is in a full-screen web page or in an iframe.<br>
                                        In the first case the game will fit the screen size, in the second, that of the iframe.<br>
                                        If the iframe size matches that of the screen, the game will fit accordingly.<br> 
                                        The alignment will be proportioned to the aspect ratio of the game.<br>
                                        To install the game in a WordPress website, we suggest to use our plugin <a href="http://codecanyon.net/item/ctl-arcade-wordpress-plugin/13856421?ref=codethislab"> CTL Arcade </a>. <br><br>

		<h3 id="cssFiles"><strong>E) CSS Files and Structure</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>

		<p>The game use two CSS files. The first one is a generic reset file. Many browser interpret the default behavior of html elements differently. By using a general reset CSS file, we can work round this. 
		Keep in mind, that these values might be overridden somewhere else in the file.</p> 

		<p>The second file contains all of the specific stylings for the canvas and some hack to be fully compatible with all most popular mobile devices</p>  

		<hr>
		
		<h3 id="javascript"><strong>F) Source Code</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		
		<p>This game contains:</p>
		
		<ol>
			<li>jQuery</li>
			<li>Our custom scripts</li>
			<li>CreateJs plugin</li>
		</ol>
		  
		<ol>
			<li>jQuery is a Javascript library that greatly reduces the amount of code that you must write.</li>
			<li>The game have the following js files:

				<li>CVector2: this class manages the calculations between 2 vectors</li>
				<li>CMath: this class manages the calculations</li>
				<li>ctl_utils: this file manages the canvas resize and its centering</li>
				<li>sprite_lib: this class loads all images declared in the main class</li>
				<li>settings: general game settings</li>
				<li>CLang: global string variables for language localization</li>
				<li>CPreloader: simple text preloader to show resources loading progress</li>

			</ul>

			</li>
			<li>CreateJs is a suite of modular libraries and tools which work together to enable rich interactive content on open web technologies via HTML5.
			</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>Resuming, the complete game flow is the following: </p>
		<ol>
			<li>The index.html file calls the CMain.js file after ready event is called</li>
			<li>The main class calls CPreloader.js to init preloader text and start sprite loading</li>
			<li>When all sprites contained in "/sprites" and "/sounds" folder are loaded, the main class removes the preloader and calls the CMenu.js file that shows the main menu</li>
			<li>If the user click the Play button in main menu, the CHelp.js class is called, then, after this, the CGame.js Class is called and game starts</li>
			<li>If the user click on the exit button in the down-right corner, the game returns to the menu screen</li>
